# Local Cluster

## How does it work?

This project spins up a Docker Registry container named `kind-registry` and a Kubernetes Kind cluster
named `flux` under the same Docker network. Then it installs Flux and configures it to upgrade itself
from the latest OCI artifact published at `ghcr.io/fluxcd/flux-manifests`. Before an upgrade, Flux
verifies that the OCI artifacts are signed by the Flux team with Cosign and GitHub OIDC.

The Docker registry is exposed on the local machine on `localhost:5050` and inside the cluster
on `kind-registry:5000`. The registry servers two purposes:
- hosts container images e.g. `docker push localhost:5050/podinfo:test1`
- hosts OCI artifacts e.g. `flux push artifact oci://localhost:5050/podinfo-manifests:test1`

To facilitate ingress access to the Flux UI and any other
application running inside the cluster, the Kubernetes Kind container
binds to port `80` and `443` on localhost.
Ingress is handled by Kubernetes ingress-nginx and self-signed TLS certs
are provided by cert-manager.

To monitor how the deployed applications perform on the cluster,
the kube-prometheus-stack and metrics-server Helm charts are installed at
bootstrap along with the Flux Grafana dashboards.

To monitor and debug Flux using a Web UI, the Weave GitOps Helm chart is
installed at bootstrap.


## How to get started?

### Prerequisites

Start by cloning the repository locally:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/platformcompass/wayfinder.git
cd wayfinder
```

Install Kubernetes kind, kubectl, flux and other CLI tools with Homebrew:

```shell
make tools
```

The complete list of tools can be found in the `Brewfile`.

Note that the minimum required version of Flux is `v2.0.0-rc.1`.

### Bootstrap

Start the dev environment with:

```shell
make up
```

The `make up` command performs the following steps:
- creates the Docker registry container if it’s not already running
- creates the Kubernetes Kind cluster if it’s not already running
- pushes the Kubernetes manifests as OCI artifacts to the local registry
  - `locahost:5050/flux-cluster-sync` is generated from `kubernetes/clusters/local`
  - `locahost:5050/flux-infra-sync` is generated from `kubernetes/infra`
  - `locahost:5050/flux-apps-sync` is generated from `kubernetes/apps`
- installs Flux on the clusters and configures it to self upgrade from `oci://ghcr.io/fluxcd/flux-manifests`
- waits for Flux to reconcile the cluster addons from `oci://kind-registry:5000/flux-infra-sync`
- waits for Flux to reconcile the demo apps from `oci://kind-registry:5000/flux-apps-sync`

### Access Flux UI

![flux-ui](docs/img/weave-gitops.png)

Add the following domains to `/etc/hosts`:

```txt
127.0.0.1 podinfo.flux.local
127.0.0.1 grafana.flux.local
127.0.0.1 ui.flux.local
```

Verify that the NGINX ingress self-signed TLS works:

```shell
make check
```

Access the Flux UI and Grafana using the username `admin` and password `flux`:

- [http://ui.flux.local/applications](http://ui.flux.local/applications)
- [http://grafana.flux.local/d/flux-control-plane](http://grafana.flux.local/d/flux-control-plane/flux-control-plane?orgId=1&refresh=10s) (username: admin, password: flux)
- [http://grafana.flux.local/d/flux-cluster](http://grafana.flux.local/d/flux-cluster/flux-cluster-stats?orgId=1&refresh=10s)

Access the demo application on [http://podinfo.flux.local](http://podinfo.flux.local/).

### Sync local changes

Add a label to the `apps` namespace definition:

```shell
yq eval ‘.metadata.labels.env=“dev”’ -i ./kubernetes/apps/namespace.yaml
```

Validate the Kubernetes manifests and Flux custom resources:

```shell
make validate
```

Push the changes to the local registry with:

```shell
make sync
```

Verify that Flux has reconciled the namespace:

```shell
kubectl get ns apps —show-labels
```

### Teardown

Delete the registry and the Kubernetes cluster with:

```shell
make down
```
